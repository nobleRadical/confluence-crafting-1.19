# Confluence Crafing

A vanilla-style autocrafter, in that the setup is weird, requires redstone, and doesn't take any continous resource, like power or fuel.  

To use the mod, you'll need to set up a confluence crafting system.  
#### Setup

1. Craft the thing

2. Arrange 9 cauldrons on top of the table in a 3x3 grid, like so:

3. Drop items into the cauldron grid in the shape of a crafting recipe. The absolute orientation doesn't matter, but it should look like a valid recipe when viewed from the top.

4. Give it a redstone signal. If the recipe is correct, it'll craft the item and place it in an internal inventory. Get the item with a hopper.

#### Tips

I've found that the best way to automate this thing is to put droppers directly on top of the cauldrons with hoppers going into them, activating the droppers then the table a few redstone ticks later. You can see my example setup in some of the attached images.  

Because this setup doesn't let you see the items, I've also added glass cauldrons. They can't hold liquids, but they can be used in the auto crafting system. They are crafted like this:

I welcome feedback, so tell me what you think of this mod!
